{"car": ["\nAs stated before, competition is the key when doing business with the City of Antioch. Most procurement actions with a dollar value of $5,000.00 or more will be competitively bid. This may be in the form of a written bid or a telephone bid. All purchases over fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) are formal bids and are subject to approval by the City Council. This type of bid will only be accepted when all correspondence is sealed.\nPlease read all bid and proposal forms carefully. The City explicitly explains each detail required to meet minimum specifications. Please be sure you can comply with all the requirements before bidding. If the material is unclear or other complications arise, contact the Purchasing Office as soon as possible. Do not wait until the date of the bid opening.\nClosing time for all bids, formal and informal, is 2:00 p.m. of the closing date noted on quotation form.\nAll bids must be received by the requesting department prior to closing time and date specified. Late bids will not be accepted.\nUpon bid award, all bid documents will be available for examination in accordance with the State of California Public Disclosure Laws.\n\n"]}
